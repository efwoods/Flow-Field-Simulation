# Flow Field Simulation

![Flow Field Simulation Animation](/imgs/output.gif)

This is a study of simulating particle movement through the ocean currents of the Philippine Archipelago. 
The results are obtained using a **squared-exponential kernel function** to calculate the conditional distribution based upon a set of real-world flow velocities. 
The predictions of debris movement are subsequently visualize and the results documented.
